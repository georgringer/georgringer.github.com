TYPO3 CMS 7.4 will be released soon and there will be some really awesome features included! I am looking forward to this version so much!
<!--more-->

TYPO3 CMS 7.4 will be the next version to be released. So many changes are happening that fast that it is hard to keep up - even for myself. 
Therefore I want to show you the most interesting changes. 
If you want to see the full list, just check out [the details on docs.typo3.org](http://docs.typo3.org/typo3cms/extensions/core/latest/#features).


## Usability

As promised, the usability is one of the focus areas for the version 7.

### Allow real copies of content elements into foreign languages

It is now possible to **copy** a content element from a different language in the page module.

### Lock edit for tt_content

Since ages, it is possible to restrict any page to be edited by administrators only. Now it is possible to lock also content elements.

**Typical use cases can be:**

- An editor is allowed to edit content elements on any page but the text of the imprint must only be edited by admins.
- A "super editor" is allowed to create plugins for a news extension but he is not allowed to change the settings of the news plugin on the home page.

### Show a dialog for existing files on upload

This is one of the most awesome features I have seen lately. 
If the drag'n'drop is used in the file list and assets are already available in the selected folder, a cool overlay will be shown:

![Upload files](/assets/typo3-dragndrop-filelist.png)

The user can select to skip the upload, rename the file (which appends the well known **_01** to the file name) or to override the file.

### Avatars for backend users

Avatars are helpful to personalize the CMS. The image is shown at various places like the toolbar, the element information popup and in the access module.

## Technical stuff

### PageTS dataprovider for backend layouts

Backend layouts are great and now the core provides a possibility to have those defined in TsConfig. 
This makes it possible to have those under version control without needint a custom provider or extension.

### Make table display order configurable in List module

It is now (again) possible to sort the tables in the list module by a custom order which can be defined in the TsConfig: ::

	mod.web_list.tableDisplayOrder.<tableName> {
	  before = <tableA>, <tableB>, ...
	  after = <tableA>, <tableB>, ...
	}

## ... and a lot more

There is a lot more to discover in the next version! Just take a look at [docs.typo3.org/typo3cms/extensions/core/latest](http://docs.typo3.org/typo3cms/extensions/core/latest/).

Don't be scared about the amount of breaking changes and deprecations! Most of them are related to coude you have never used!
