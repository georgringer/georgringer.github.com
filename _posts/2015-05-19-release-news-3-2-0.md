I am proud to present the release of EXT:news 3.2.0. Dozens of hours have been spent to improve this extension.

## Features

Most of the goals which have been described in a [previous post](2015-05-19-conclusion-sponsoring-news) have been reached. 
Take a look at the [ChangeLog](http://docs.typo3.org/typo3cms/extensions/news/latest/Misc/Changelog/3-2-0.html) for a full report!
 
### New documentation

The documentation has been overworked and got a new structure. As you can see at [docs.typo3.org/typo3cms/extensions/news/latest](http://docs.typo3.org/typo3cms/extensions/news/latest/), it is divided into 3 main parts:

- For editors
- For administrators
- For developers

Furthermore it is now located at [GitHub](https://github.com/georgringer/news-documentation) which makes it easier to contribute. 

### Internal changes

- The extension is now based on namespaces
- Change of proxy-class generation


## Cheer with me!

**3.2.0 will be my personal "wedding release" to cheer for my wedding on June 13th.**.

Do me a favor and send me a postcard if you are using one of my extensions. You can find my address in the [imprint](/about/). That would be awesome!
