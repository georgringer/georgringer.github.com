I would like to share the conclusion after my call for sponsors.
<!--more-->

In a [previous post](/2015/02/25/Sponsoring-ext-news.html) I presented the roadmap of my TYPO3 extension news. 
Since then some people and companies contacted me for donations and that was a really great feeling! 
All of those are already very active in the TYPO3 community!

Open-source is all about sharing which works best in both ways! Therefore I would like to thank (ordered by date):

- Olivier Dobberkau
- Moritz Krauß
- Claus Due 
- Christian Kuhn
- Andreas Beyl
- Cyberhouse GmbH

Some words about the sponsors!
