The most important changes are related to the development of TYPO3 CMS 7. The pace is really high and it is not easy to keep up with all the changes.
 
## Important changes

1 change is kind of important as it removes a previously added field in the table *sys_category* to assign frontenduser groups to a category. This field was never eveluated and is therefore dropped again.

Please checkout the [ChangeLog](http://docs.typo3.org/typo3cms/extensions/news/latest/Misc/Changelog/3-2-1.html) for all important information.
