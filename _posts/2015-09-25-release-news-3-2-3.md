The version 3.2.3 of the popular extension news has just been release to ter. Its target is 6.2 LTS only
<!--more-->

To keep up the development speed of TYPO3 CMS 7.x, I needed to change my policy for supporting 7 and 6.2.

## 6.2 LTS

EXT:news versions 3.x will support only the current LTS 6.2. 

If you are using GIT, please checkout the branch ``6x``.

## 7 LTS

Having a dedicated release for 7 does have a lot of advantages:

* PHP 5.5 is required which makes writing code a lot easier
* Full support of 7.x features without checking the versions all the time
* No entries in the deprecation log


A release will be done soon, starting with the version number 4.0.0. This will happen in 1-2 weeks. Until then, please use git and the master branch.
